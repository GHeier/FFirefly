## **🚀 Welcome**  
Welcome to **Quasi**, a computational physics toolkit designed to be easy to both use and extend. Users interact via a simple input file (an example is sample.cfg) and easy python wrappers. Developers can easily extend the codebase by adding new models and solvers in whatever language they prefer.

### **🔹 Languages Supported**
- **Fortran** 
- **C** 
- **C++** 
- **Python** 
- **Julia** 

### **🔹 Current Calculation Categories**
- Compute **self-energy (Σ)** and **2PI vertices (Γ) (with possible corrections)**  
- Superconducting Gap calculations, both BCS and Eliashberg
- Response functions (polarization, etc)
- Fermi surface calculations and displays
- Band structure/density of states calculations and displays
